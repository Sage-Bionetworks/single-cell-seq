# single-cell-seq
The goal of this repository is to maintain a set of tools that facilitate various aspects of single cell RNA-seq, both locally and remotely.

### Immune Cell Annotation Work
These tools will help annotate immune cells in scRNA-seq data files.

### Tumor Deconvolution Tools
We can link to relevant tools/repos here.

### Alignment/Processing Tools
We will work to add tool to this over the summer.
